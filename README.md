# services
notes and configs for optimized and secure installation of services

This repo is a result of spending frustrating hours to configure infrastructure
and basic services (like rabbitmq) and then doing it over and over again.

The idea is to provide a production-runnable script(s)/configurations that can
be referred to quickly in case of emergencies. So all the stuff here might not
be production ready to start with but the aim is to do exactly that.

PR's and suggestions welcome.
